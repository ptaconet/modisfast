abstract = {Data from the first Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the NASA Terra Platform are being used to provide a new generation of land data products in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Earth Science Enterprise, global change research and natural resource management. The MODIS products include global data sets heretofore unavailable, derived from new moderate resolution spectral bands with spatial resolutions of 250 m to 1 km. A partnership between Science Team members and the MODIS Science Data Support Team is producing data sets of unprecedented volume and number for the land research and applications. This overview paper provides a summary of the instrument performance and status, the data production system, the products, their status and availability for land studies.}

abstract = {This paper provides a review and summary status of the research underway by the NASA Terra Aqua Suomi-NPP Land Discipline Team to provide continuity of global land data products from the NASA Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The two MODIS instruments on the NASA Earth Observing System Terra (morning overpass) and Aqua (afternoon overpass) platforms have provided more than twenty years of data. The peer-reviewed land products generated from MODIS are now being transitioned to production using VIIRS inputs, with the intention of providing dynamic continuity for the Aqua observations. As part of that process, the products from the two instruments are undergoing intercomparison and evaluation. These results are provided where available and show promising levels of agreement and accuracy in all cases. The paper also offers options for establishing continuity of Terra MODIS data products.}
