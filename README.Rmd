## News

2025-09-03 : collections [MOD44B.061](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD44B.061) and [MOD44W.061](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD44W.061) were added in the list of available collections (only available in the development version of the package) ! 

2025-07-17 : `modisfast` v1.0.2 available on CRAN ! See [here](https://github.com/ptaconet/modisfast/blob/master/NEWS.md) for fixes. 

## Overview

**`modisfast`** is an R package designed for **easy** and **fast** downloads of [**MODIS**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/modis) Land products, [**VIIRS**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/viirs) Land products, and [**GPM**](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data) (Global Precipitation Measurement Mission) Earth Observation data.

`modisfast` uses the abilities offered by the [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/about/) framework (*Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol*) to download a subset of Earth Observation data cube, along spatial, temporal or any other data dimension (depth, ...). This way, it reduces downloading time and disk usage to their minimum : no more 1° x 1° MODIS tiles with 10 bands when your region of interest is only 30 km x 30 km wide and you need 2 bands ! Moreover, `modisfast` enables parallel downloads of data.

This package is hence particularly suited for retrieving MODIS or VIIRS data **over long time series** and **over areas**, rather than short time series and points.

Importantly, the robust, sustainable, and cost-free [foundational framework](#foundational-framework) of `modisfast`, both for the data provider (NASA) and the software (R, OPeNDAP, the `tidyverse` and `GDAL` suite of packages and software), guarantees the long-term reliability and open-source nature of the package.

By enabling to download subsets of data cubes, `modisfast` facilites the access to Earth science data for R users in places where internet connection is slow or expensive and promotes digital sobriety for our research work. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of `modisfast` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with :

``` r
install.packages("modisfast")
```

or the development version (to get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version) with : 

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("ptaconet/modisfast")
```

## Get Started 

Accessing and opening MODIS data with `modisfast` is a simple 3-steps workflow. This example shows how to download and import a one-year-long monthly time series of MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 1 km spatial resolution over the whole country of Madagascar.

**1/ First, define the variables of interest (ROI, time frame, collection, and bands) :**

```{r , eval = F, message=F}
# Load the packages
library(modisfast)
library(sf)
library(terra)

# ROI and time range of interest
roi <- st_as_sf(data.frame(id = "madagascar", geom = "POLYGON((41.95 -11.37,51.26 -11.37,51.26 -26.17,41.95 -26.17,41.95 -11.37))"), wkt = "geom", crs = 4326) # a ROI of interest, format sf polygon
time_range <- as.Date(c("2023-01-01", "2023-12-31")) # a time range of interest

# MODIS collections and variables (bands) of interest
collection <- "MOD13A3.061" # run mf_list_collections() for an exhaustive list of collections available
variables <- c("_1_km_monthly_NDVI") # run mf_list_variables("MOD13A3.061") for an exhaustive list of variables available for the collection "MOD13A3.061"
```

**2/ Then, get the URL of the data and download them :**

```{r , eval = F, message=F}
## Login to Earthdata servers with your EOSDIS credentials.
# To create an account (free) go to : https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/.
log <- mf_login(credentials = c("username", "password")) # set your own EOSDIS username and password

## Get the URLs of the data
urls <- mf_get_url(
  collection = collection,
  variables = variables,
  roi = roi,
  time_range = time_range
)

## Download the data. By default the data is downloaded in a temporary directory, but you can specify a folder
res_dl <- mf_download_data(urls, parallel = TRUE)
```

**3/ And finally, import the data in R as a `terra::SpatRaster` object using the function `mf_import_data()`** ( :warning: see [here](https://ptaconet.github.io/modisfast/articles/get_started.html#warning-import) why you should use this function, instead of the original `terra::rast()`, in the context of `modisfast`) :

```{r , eval = F, message=F}
r <- mf_import_data(
  path = dirname(res_dl$destfile[1]),
  collection = collection,
  proj_epsg = 4326
)

terra::plot(r, col = rev(terrain.colors(20)))
```

- a ["Get data on several regions or periods of interest simultaneously" article](https://ptaconet.github.io/modisfast/articles/modisfast2.html) detailing advanced functionalities of `modisfast` (for multi-time frame or multi-regions data access);
- a ["Full use case" article](https://ptaconet.github.io/modisfast/articles/use_case.html) showcasing an example of use of the package in a scientific context (here: landscape epidemiology).


<!--
## Objectives
modisfast provides an entry point to some specific OPeNDAP servers (e.g. MODIS, VNP, GPM or SMAP) via HTTPS. The development of the package was motivated by the following reasons : 
* **Providing a simple and single way in R to download data stored on heterogeneous servers** : People that use Earth science data often struggle with data access. In modisfast we propose a harmonized way to download data from various providers that have implemented access to their data through OPeNDAP.
* **Fastening the data import phase**, especially for large time series analysis.
Apart from these performance aspects, ethical considerations have driven the development of this package :
* **Facilitating the access to Earth science data for R users in places where internet connection is slow or expensive** : Earth science products are generally huge files that can be quite difficult to download in places with slow internet connection, even more if large time series are needed. By enabling to download strictly the data that is needed, the products become more accessible in those places;
* **Caring about the environmental digital impact of our research work** : Downloading data has an impact on environment and to some extent contributes to climate change. By downloading only the data that is need (rather than e.g a whole MODIS tile, or a global SMAP or GPM dataset) we somehow promote digital sobriety. 
* **Supporting the open-source-software movement** : The OPeNDAP is developed and advanced openly and collaboratively, by the non-profit [OPeNDAP, Inc.](https://www.opendap.org/about/) This open, powerfull and standard data access protocol is more and more used, by major Earth science data providers (e.g. NASA or NOAA). Using OPeNDAP means supporting methods for data access protocols that are open, build collaboratively and shared.

## Collections available in `modisfast`

Currently `modisfast` supports download of `r nrow(mf_list_collections())` data collections, extracted from the following meta-collections : 

* [MODIS land products](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/modis) made available by the [NASA / USGS LP DAAC](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/lp-daac) ( :arrow_right: [source OPeNDAP server](https://opendap.cr.usgs.gov/opendap/hyrax/)) ;
* [VIIRS land products](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/viirs) made available by the [NASA / USGS LP DAAC](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/lp-daac) ( :arrow_right: [source OPeNDAP server](https://opendap.cr.usgs.gov/opendap/hyrax/))
* [Global Precipitation Measurement](https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/GPM) (GPM) made available by the [NASA / JAXA GES DISC](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) ( :arrow_right: [source OPeNDAP server](https://gpm1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/opendap/hyrax/GPM_L3/)).

Details of each product available for download are provided in the tables below or through the function `mf_list_collections()`.


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=F,message=F}

fun_display_coll <- function(filts){
  
  cols <- mf_list_collections() %>%
  dplyr::filter(nature %in% filts) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(collection = cell_spec(collection, "html", link = doi)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(spatial_resolution_m = paste0(spatial_resolution_m, " m")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(temporal_resolution = paste0(temporal_resolution," ",temporal_resolution_unit)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(temporal_resolution = ifelse(temporal_resolution=="1 day", "Daily", temporal_resolution)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(start_date = paste0(start_date," to present")) %>%
  dplyr::select(collection, source, nature, long_name, spatial_resolution_m, temporal_resolution, start_date) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(nature, source, spatial_resolution_m, rev(temporal_resolution)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Collection = collection, Type = nature, Name = long_name, Source = source, 'Spatial resolution' = spatial_resolution_m, 'Temporal resolution' = temporal_resolution, 'Temporal extent' = start_date) %>%
  kable("html", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed"))
  
  return(cols)
  
}

cols_natures <- sort(unique(mf_list_collections()$nature))

```


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=F, message=F, results='asis'}
for(i in seq_along(cols_natures)){
  if(i==1){
     cat('<details><summary><b>',cols_natures[i],'</b> data collections <b>(click to expand)</b></summary>')
  } else {
      cat('<details><summary><b>',cols_natures[i],'</b> data collections</summary>')
  }
  cat(knitr::asis_output(fun_display_coll(cols_natures[i])))
  cat('</details>')
}
```


## Manual testing of the functionality

Since most `modisfast` functions depend on EarthData credentials, automated tests are disabled. However, after installation, users can manually test the package's functionality by running these lines of code :

```{r, eval = F, echo=T,message=F}
# replace "username" and "password" with your own EOSDIS (Earthdata) credentials 
earthdata_un <- "username" 
earthdata_pw <- "password"

devtools::test("modisfast")
```

## Foundational framework  {#foundational-framework}

Technically, `modisfast` is a programmatic interface (R wrapper) to several NASA [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) servers. OPeNDAP is the acronym for *Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol* and designates both the software, the access protocol, and the corporation that develops them. The OPeNDAP is designed to simplify access to structured and high-volume data, such as satellite products, over the Web. It is a collaborative effort involving multiple institutions and companies, with open-source code, free software, and adherence to the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.ogc.org/) (OGC) standards. It is widely used by NASA, which partly finances it. 

A key feature of OPeNDAP is its capability to apply filters at the data download process, ensuring that only the necessary data is retrieved. These filters, specified within a URL, can be spatial, temporal, or dimensional. Although powerful, OPeNDAP URLs are not trivial to build. `modisfast` facilitates this process by constructing the URL based on the spatial, temporal, and dimensional filters provided by the user in the function `mf_get_url()`.

Let's take an example to understand.

The following URL :arrow_down:

https<nolink>://opendap.cr.usgs.gov/opendap/hyrax/MOD11A2.061/h17v08.ncml.nc4?MODIS_Grid_8Day_1km_LST_eos_cf_projection,LST_Day_1km[775:793][55:140][512:560],LST_Night_1km[775:793][55:140][512:560],QC_Day[775:793][55:140][512:560],QC_Night[775:793][55:140][512:560],time[775:793],YDim[55:140],XDim[512:560]

is a link to download the following subset of MOD11A2.061 data in netCDF :

- bands LST_Day_1km, LST_Night_1km, QC_Day, QC_Night ;
- each available date between the 2017-01-01 and the 2017-06-01 ; 
- within the following bounding box (lon/lat): -5.41 8.84, -5.82 9.54. 

The indices within the `[]` refer to values encoding for the spatial and temporal filters.

These OPeNDAP URLs are not trivial to build. `modisfast` converts the spatial, temporal and dimensional filters (R objects) provided by the user through the function `mf_get_url()` into the appropriate OPeNDAP URL(s). Subsequently, the function `mf_download_data()` allows for downloading the data using the [`httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) and `parallel` packages. 

## Comparison with similar R packages

There are other R packages available for accessing MODIS data. Below is a comparison of modisfast with other packages available for downloading chunks of MODIS or VIIRS data :
